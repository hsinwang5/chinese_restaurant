# restaurant website

This is a responsive practice website for local Chinese-Japanese restaurant with social media presence. The base template is the Panda Express website. 

The code is written in html, sass/scss, and vanilla javascript with node.js backend + express routing. There is intention to refactor the front-end to React when feasible.

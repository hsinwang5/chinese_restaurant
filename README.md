# restaurant website

This is a responsive practice website for local Chinese-Japanese restaurant with social media presence. The base template is the Panda Express website. It is not intended to be a final design and more of a playground to try various things in a more serious project setting.

The code is written in html, sass/scss, and vanilla javascript with node.js backend + express routing. There is intention to refactor the front-end to React when feasible.

Note that the website is hosted on a free Heroku instance which means that it may take up to 30 seconds for the server instance to wake from hibernation when first clicked.
